Homepage for the first homework/challenge, making Horiseon pretty and fully functioning while taking away some of the redundant parts of the code and that which was in but made little sense, such as some style classes having different names but being the same thing repeated two to three times over. Also made use of the section tag instead of continuing to reuse the div tag as it confused things even more.
